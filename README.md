how to use git:

First of all -if you are not using github desktop- you will need to download git and install it on your computer. Other wise on github desktop it is pretty simple and guided.
Once installed, you will be able to download the repository, but first you have to set up a couple of things:

- navigate to the folder where you want to download your repo.
- right click in the folder and select "git bash here"

it will open a terminal like window, but that is not the command window, it is a git command window from which you communicate with the server where the repository is hosted. Now in the git bash terminal write these commands:

- git init

now instead of TYPE write global or local whether you want to set global or local configurations. The same applies for USERNAME (write your github username) and EMAIL (write your github email):

- git config --TYPE user.name "USERNAME"
- git config --TYPE user.email "EMAIL"

(note the apices, you will need to write them)

then:
- git clone PASTE_THE_URL
